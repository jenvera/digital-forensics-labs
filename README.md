# Lab 05: Analyzing Images to Identify Suspicious or Modified Files (E3)

This lab was completed as part of my Digital Forensics coursework at De Anza College, where I am pursuing a Certificate of Achievement in Cybersecurity with a focus on digital forensics and investigation.

## 🔍 Overview

In this lab, I used **Magnet Forensics E3** to analyze a suspect drive image. The objective was to identify suspicious or modified image files that could potentially be linked to criminal activity or inappropriate content.

## 🧪 Objectives

- Create a new case in the E3 platform
- Load and analyze the “Suspect Drive 01” evidence file
- Use **Image Analyzer** to sort, categorize, and flag image files
- Differentiate between clean, suspicious, and recovered files
- Document and capture all findings

## 📊 Results

| Category                               | Number of Files |
|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| Total Sorted Files                     | 3152             |
| Clean Files                            | 204              |
| Suspicious Files                       | 29               |
| Clean (Unallocated Space)              | 94               |
| Suspicious (Unallocated Space)         | 12               |
